## Branches and commits

For standardization purposes, branch names and commit messages must follow these patterns:

- Branch names must start with the ticket ID + a brief descriptive title (in English and lowercase).  
  Example: cia-123-task-title;

- Commit messages should follow this pattern: [ticket_id] <type>: Commit Info.  
  Example: [CIA-123] feat: Brief commit description.

Note that the ticket ID must always be written in uppercase.
